# Electircal_PowerSystem_Fault_Detection_
This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning-based fault detection system for electric power systems. The system is designed to detect various types of faults, such as short circuits, open circuits, and overcurrent, in real-time using historical data and real-time sensor readings.
