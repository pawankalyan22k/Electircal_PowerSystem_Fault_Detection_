**Fault Detection in Electric Power Systems using Machine Learning**

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning-based fault detection system for electric power systems. The system is designed to detect various types of faults, such as short circuits, open circuits, and overcurrent, in real-time using historical data and real-time sensor readings. 

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering techniques to prepare data for model training.
* **Model Development:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks) for fault classification.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training and evaluation of models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
* **Real-time Fault Detection:** Integration of trained models with real-time sensor data to detect faults as they occur.
* **Visualization Tools:** Visualization of data, model performance, and fault detection results.

**Potential Applications:**

* **Enhanced Power System Reliability:** Early detection and isolation of faults to minimize outages and improve system reliability.
* **Reduced Maintenance Costs:** Predictive maintenance strategies based on fault detection to optimize resource allocation.
* **Improved Power Quality:** Identification and mitigation of power quality issues caused by faults.
